Project 6 Questions

Consider the election donation data:

 

https://www.fec.gov/data/advanced/?tab=bulk-data

 

from "Contributions by individuals" for 2017-18. Download this data.


Unzip the file (in the terminal).

 

Use the cat command to concatenate all of the files in the by_date folder into one large file (in the terminal).

 

Read the data dictionary:

 

https://www.fec.gov/campaign-finance-data/contributions-individuals-file-description/


Hint: When working with a file that is not comma separated, you can use the read.delim command in R, and *be sure to specify* the character that separates the various pieces of data on a row.
To do this, you can read the help file for read.delim by typing: ?read.delim
(Look for the "field separator character".)

Also there is no header, so also use header=F

Question 1:  Rank the states according to how many times that their citizens contributed (i.e., total number of donations). Which 5 states made the largest numbers of contributions?

Question 2:  Use awk in the terminal to verify your solution to question 1.

Question 3:  Now (instead) rank the states according to how much money their citizens contributed (i.e., total amount of donations).  Which 5 states contributed the largest amount of money?

(Optional!!) challenge question:  Use awk in the terminal to verify your solution to question 3.
This can be done with 1 line of awk code, but you need to use arrays in awk,
as demonstrated (for instance) on Andrey's solution on this page:
https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/242946/using-awk-to-sum-the-values-of-a-column-based-on-the-values-of-another-column/242949

Submit your solutions in RMarkdown.
For question 2 (and for the optional challenge question), it is OK to just
put your code into your comments in RMarkdown,
so that the TA's can see how you solved question 2,
but (of course) the awk code does not run in RMarkdown!
You are just showing the awk code to the TA's in this way!
