Project 2 Questions

Due Date:  Thursday, September 13, 2018, by 5 PM

 

1.  Use the airline data stored in this directory:

/depot/statclass/data/dataexpo2009

1a. What was the average arrival delay (in minutes) for flights in 2005?

1b. What was the average departure delay (in minutes) for flights in 2005?

1cd. Now revise your solution to 1ab, to account for the delays (of both types) in the full set of data, across all years.


2. Revise your solutions to 1abcd to only include flights that took place on the weekends.

 

 

3.  Consider the June 2017 taxi cab data, which is located in this folder:

/depot/statclass/data/taxi2018

What is the average distance of a taxi cab ride in New York City in June 2017?
