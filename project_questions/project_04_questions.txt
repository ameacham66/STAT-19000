Project 4 Questions

Due Date:  Thursday, September 27, 2018, by 5 PM

 

Revisit the map code on the STAT 19000 webpage:

http://www.stat.purdue.edu/datamine/19000/

 

Goal:  Make a map of the State of Indiana, which shows all of Indiana's airports.

 

Notes:

You will need to install the ggmap package, which takes a few minutes to install.

 

You can read in the data about the airports from the Data Expo 2009 Supplementary Data:

 

http://stat-computing.org/dataexpo/2009/supplemental-data.html

 

It will be necessary to extract (only) the airports with "state" equal to "IN"

 

It is possible to either dynamically load the longitude and latitude of Indianapolis from Google,

or to manually specify the longitude and latitude (e.g., by looking them up yourself in Google and entering them).

 

After you plot the State of Indiana with all of the airports shown,

you can print the resulting plot to a pdf file as follows:

 

dev.print(pdf, "filename.pdf")

 

Please submit your GitHub code in a ".R" file and also the resulting ".pdf" file.

 

It is not (yet) necessary to submit your work in RMarkdown.
