Project 3 Questions

Due Date:  Thursday, September 20, 2018, by 5 PM

 

Use R to revisit these questions.  They can each be accomplished with 1 line of code.

 

[[It is OK to submit this project as a ".R" file in GitHub.  In the near future, I hope to move us into RMarkdown, but I don't want to overwhelm students with this at the start.  So just submit your ".R" files into GitHub.  *As always* please include your solution and also comments about your method of solution, so that the graders can quickly check your work!]]
