# 1. We switch to the directory for the airline data

cd /depot/statclass/data/dataexpo2009

# 1a. The number of flights that occurred, on every day of the year,
#     can be obtained by extracting the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd fields,
#     sorting the data, and then
#     summarizing the data using the uniq command with the -c flag

sort 2005.csv | cut -d, -f1-3 | sort | uniq -c

#     The first few lines of the output are:
#  16477 2005,10,1
#  19885 2005,10,10
#  19515 2005,10,11
#  19701 2005,10,12
#  19883 2005,10,13

#     and the last few lines of the output are:
#  20051 2005,9,6
#  19629 2005,9,7
#  19968 2005,9,8
#  19938 2005,9,9
#      1 Year,Month,DayofMonth

# 1b. The day of the year on which the most flights occur can be found by
#     sorting the results above, in numerical order, using sort -n
#     and then (if desired, although it is optional) we can
#     extract the last line of the output using tail -n1

sort 2005.csv | cut -d, -f1-3 | sort | uniq -c | sort -n | tail -n1

#     and we conclude that the most flights occur on August 5:

  21041 2005,8,5

# 2. We can extract the 9th field, which is the carrier (i.e., the airline company)
#    and then, in the same way as above, we can sort the data, and then we can
#    summarize the data using uniq -c
#    This yields the number of flights for each carrier.
#    We can either read the number of United or Delta flights with our eyeballs,
#    or we can use the grep command, searching for both the pattern UA and DL
#    to isolate (only) the number of flights for United and Delta, respectively.

sort 2005.csv | cut -d, -f9 | sort | uniq -c | grep "UA\|DL"

#    The output is

# 658302 DL
# 485918 UA

#    so Delta has more flights than United in 2005.

# 3. Now we change directories to consider the taxi cab data

cd ../taxi2018

#    The ".." in the previous command just indicates that we want to go up one level to
#    /depot/statclass/data
#    and then, from that point, we want to go into the taxi cab directory.
#    If this sounds complicated, then (instead) it is safe to use the longer version:

cd /depot/statclass/data/taxi2018

#    The number of passengers is given in the 4th column, passenger_count
#    We use a method that is similar to the one from the first three questions,
#    We extract the 4th column, sort the data, and then
#    summarizing the data using the uniq command with the -c flag

sort yellow_tripdata_2017-06.csv | cut -d, -f4 | sort | uniq -c

#    and the distribution of the number of passengers is:

#       1 
#     548 0
# 6933189 1
# 1385066 2
#  406162 3
#  187979 4
#  455753 5
#  288220 6
#      26 7
#      30 8
#      20 9
#       1 passenger_count

#   Notice that we have some extraneous information, i.e., there is
#   one blank line and also one line for the passenger_count (from the header)
