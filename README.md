## Submission guidelines
For all projects, place all relevant files into a folder labeled as such:
```
project_01
```
Relevant files include any temporary files you may have created to solve a problem, or RMarkdown output. If you care at all about your TAs, try to keep extraneous files out of your submitted project folders.

## View your grades
All grades will be posted on [Blackboard](https://mycourses.purdue.edu/).

## Office hours
To be determined. Stay tuned!
