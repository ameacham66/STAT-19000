1.  Use the airline data stored in this directory:

/depot/statclass/data/dataexpo2009

In the year 2005, find:
1a.  the number of flights that occurred, on every day of the year, and
1b.  find the day of the year on which the most flights occur.

2.  Again considering the year 2005, did United or Delta have more flights?

3.  Consider the June 2017 taxi cab data, which is located in this folder:

/depot/statclass/data/taxi2018

What is the distribution of the number of passengers in the taxi cab rides?  In other words, make a list of the number of rides that have 1 passenger; that have 2 passengers; etc.
